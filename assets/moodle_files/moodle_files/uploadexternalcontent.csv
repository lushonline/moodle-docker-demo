While search optimization is an extremely handy feature, it can also run up substantial storage and compute costs. In this course, learn how to implement search optimizations by measuring the cost of search optimizations for your table and adding the service to it. Next, differentiate between search optimizations and clustering and discover how to implement partitioning for external tables. Finally, practice working with views in Snowflake and differentiate between non-materialized, materialized, and secure views.

Learning C++ enables the learner to easily perceive the most trending programming languages The Programming C++ journey facilitates the learners to understand the functional programming model and Object-oriented programming model and to identify which model to apply under what circumstances. Each learning path presents adequate chances for writing programs and identifying & fixing errors. As the learners keep gaining knowledge, they will demonstrate coding skills in lab practice, capstone projects, and final assessments. This journey is a blend of all the fundamentals and the new features of C++. The intent here is to provide the learners with all the most crucial information in one place to write correct, portable, professional-quality code.
